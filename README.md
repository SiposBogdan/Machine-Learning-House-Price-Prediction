# 🏠 Machine Learning Price Prediction

This project walks through a **complete machine learning workflow** for predicting **housing prices** using Python and Scikit-learn.  
It’s a structured notebook - from data loading and exploration to feature engineering, model training and evaluation - using practical, reproducible code.

## 🌟 Objective

The main goal is to predict **median housing prices** based on several demographic and geographic features.  
By following the steps in this notebook, I did:
- Prepared a real-world dataset for machine learning.
- Selected and applied appropriate preprocessing techniques.
- Trained and tuned regression models.
- Evaluated and compared model performance.
